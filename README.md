# Superheroes Node - a tutorial to enable Payments acceptance via Payabbhi Node.js library

Superheroes is a tutorial for enabling payments acceptance via Payabbhi Node.js Library.

The `Payments Acceptance workflow` is implemented as described in the Payabbhi [Integration Guide](https://payabbhi.com/docs/integration).

The tutorial is in the form of a web application that provides a Superheroes Store for
purchasing a superhero to run your errands.

The Superheroes tutorial is designed to take you to full implementation in four graded steps:
- Step 1 : Basic implementation of `Payments Acceptance workflow`
- Step 2 : Add `Payment Response Handling`
- Step 3 : Add `Exception Handling`
- Step 4 : Reorganize and Refactor to bring everything together
